      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is used to run applications within an isolated environment called a container. Containers allow for processes to run on the host computer while being bound by restrictions or limits. The benefit of Docker is that since the process runs right on the kernal, you don't have to worry about compatability issues. </p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is an image copy of an operating system that allows a computer to display a copy of a computer. The virtual machine cannot tamper with the host computer. This allows a basic display to display a more advanced computer via virtual machine without needed to have the physical hardware on-site. </p>

      <h2>DigitalOcean</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean is a cloud computing service which means that a user can use a "private virtual machine instance" or use the computing power of DigitalOcean's servers rather than the user's local hardware to run processes. DigitalOcean calls their "private virtual machine instance" droplets and users can choose from a variety of sizes of the droplets to fit their computing needs. </p>
